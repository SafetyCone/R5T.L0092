# R5T.L0092
Foundation library, framework-typed (netstandard2.1) for general functionality.


## How this library works

This library builds on functionality in R5T.L0066, but allows use of the powerful WasFound\<T> and IChecked\<TCheck> types to simplify operator method boundaries.
This library is still limited to using framework types (not strongly-typed types).


## Allowed dependencies

* R5T.L0066 - Strictly-framework netstandard2.1 library. (Not R5T.L0071, since this is general, not Rivet-specific general, functionality.)
* R5T.L0089 - WasFound\<T> library.
* R5T.L0091 - IChecked\<TCheck> library.
